# Albion Sixth Sense
...is a simple [botfather](https://botfather.io/scripts/6/) script that notifies you everytime the number of hostile players on 
the current map changes.

It's super simple, reliable and even customizable!

A sound will be played when the game has been found on your screen. An alert sound will be played to inform you about hostile 
players.

Both sounds can be swapped out (just replace the 'alert.wav' and 'ready.wav' files with a different sound effect).
